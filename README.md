# HackRF_AIS_attacks
Some example attacks using the AIS protocol. Not to be used on the actual AIS frequencies.

To use these attacks properly, you need to download and connect the scripts to AIS-catcher.
AIS-catcher also has to be tuned to the frequency you want to listen and transmit on, by default it only uses the AIS frequencies.  

You must also insert the hackrf_id of your device(s) in the attacking scripts and listeners.
