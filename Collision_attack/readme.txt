To start the attack, run the attacker.py program and input the targets mmsi number.

If you want to simulate an attack with two or three hackrf ones, run the victim.py after running attacker.py and make sure that the target mmsi number in attacker.py is the mmsi number in victim.py

If you want to change some of the functionality of the attack, simply change attacker.py.
